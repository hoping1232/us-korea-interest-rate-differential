The presence of serial correlation and low explanatory power highlights the importance of considering additional macroeconomic factors and more advanced time-series models in future research. Future research could extend this analysis by incorporating additional macroeconomic variables such as inflation differentials, capital flows, or global risk indicators, as well as more advanced time-series models.\n"
